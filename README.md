# They Might Have Taken Our Global Pagchomp But They Won't Take Away My JS Skills
A Discord Javascript script that scans through the chat and replaces every mention of "pagchomp" with the actual pagchomp emoji, inspired by the global emoji fallout of the server called Chiaki Fan Club.

## Usage:
Ctrl+Shift+I in the Discord window and just throw everything to the console there. Needs to be updated on each restart of Discord, but aside from that works until you restart it.

## Credits:
* Chiaki Fan Club for ruining their global emoji server and forcing me to take those steps and do this script. You had one job.

* Bacorn for optimizing the script!
